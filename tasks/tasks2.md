**"Create a new /login route in the Next.js project using the existing design system (shadcn/ui, Tailwind v4, New York variant, dark mode).

Implement the following layout and content:

Center the login form vertically and horizontally on the page.
Use a max width of 420px and full-height container.

Add a heading at the top: 'Login to GovTrack'
Add a small subtext below: 'Access your dashboard and continue your work.'

Implement a Card component containing the login form.
Inside the card, include:

a. Email input field (use shadcn/ui Input)
b. Password input field (type=password)
c. A primary Button labeled 'Login' that triggers a placeholder submit handler
d. A small muted link under the button: 'Don't have an account? Get Started' linking to /get-started
e. A divider line with 'or continue with' centered
f. A secondary Button with Lucide 'Github' icon labeled 'GitHub Login' (placeholder for OAuth)

Add subtle border, shadow, and spacing consistent with existing theme.

Add a small footnote under the card:
'By continuing, you agree to our Terms & Privacy Policy.'

Make sure the navbar Login button correctly routes to /login.

Include the interactive background div placeholder behind everything, as in the hero section."**
