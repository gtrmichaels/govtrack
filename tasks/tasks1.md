**"Create a new /get-started route in the Next.js app.
Use existing styling conventions, components, and theme (shadcn/ui, Tailwind v4, New York variant, dark mode).
Implement the page with the following layout and content:

A centered header section with a bold title:
'Start Using GovTrack'

A short subtitle paragraph explaining onboarding:
'GovTrack helps public agencies, NGOs, auditors, and citizens monitor government-funded projects with transparency. Choose the role that fits how you want to engage with national projects.'

Add a 4-card grid using Card components. Each card should have:

an icon from Lucide

a title

a short 20-word description

a subtle border and hover shadow

a button at the bottom linking to respective onboarding flows (links can be placeholders for now)

The 4 cards should be:
a. 'Government Agency'
Description: 'Register your institution, publish new projects, update progress reports, and manage your national development portfolio.'
Button label: 'Register Agency'

b. 'NGO / Development Partner'
Description: 'Track the initiatives you support, upload funding utilization reports, and stay aligned with project outcomes.'
Button label: 'Join as Partner'

c. 'Auditor / Verification Body'
Description: 'Verify project progress, upload audit summaries, flag discrepancies, and strengthen public accountability.'
Button label: 'Auditor Access'

d. 'Citizen / Public Viewer'
Description: 'Browse national projects, check real progress, view budgets, and report issues affecting your community.'
Button label: 'View Projects'

Add spacing and responsiveness consistent with existing sections.

Add this page to the navbar by linking the current “Get Started” button to /get-started.

Ensure the page uses the same interactive background div placeholder as the hero section, but placed behind content.

After generating the code, ensure the 'Get Started' button in the hero and navbar properly routes to this page."**
